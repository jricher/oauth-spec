    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines methods for management of dynamic OAuth
      2.0 client registrations for use cases in which the properties of a
      registered client may need to be changed during the lifetime of the
      client. Not all authorization servers supporting dynamic client
      registration will support these management methods.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>In order for an OAuth 2.0 client to utilize an OAuth 2.0
      authorization server, the client needs specific information to interact
      with the server, including an OAuth 2.0 client identifier to use with
      that server. The <xref target="OAuth.Registration">OAuth 2.0 Dynamic
      Client Registration Protocol</xref> specification describes how an OAuth
      2.0 client can be dynamically registered with an authorization server to
      obtain this information and how metadata about the client can be
      registered with the server.</t>

      <t>This specification extends the core registration specification by
      defining a set of methods for management of dynamic OAuth 2.0 client
      registrations beyond those defined in the core registration
      specification. In some situations, the registered metadata of a client
      can change over time, either by modification at the authorization server
      or by a change in the client software itself. This specification
      provides methods for the current registration state of a client to be
      queried at the authorization server, methods for the registration of a
      client to be updated at the authorization server, and methods for the
      client to be unregistered from the authorization server.</t>

      <t>This experimental draft is intended to encourage development and
      deployment of interoperable solutions with the intent that feedback from
      this experience will inform a future standard.</t>

      <t>The client configuration endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 protected resource

      deleting a client's registered information. The location of this
      endpoint is communicated to the client through the <spanx style="verb">registration_client_uri</spanx>
      member of the client information response, as specified in <xref

      access token in all calls to this endpoint as an OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token

      <t>The client configuration endpoint MUST be protected by a
      transport-layer security mechanism, as described in <xref

        <t>To read the current configuration of the client on the

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>While the client secret can expire, the registration access token
      SHOULD NOT expire while a client is still actively registered. If this
      token were to expire, a developer or client could be left in a situation
      where they have no means of retrieving or updating the client's
      registration information. Were that the case, a new registration would
      be required, thereby generating a new client identifier. However, to
      limit the exposure surface of the registration access token, the
      registration access token MAY be rotated when the developer or client
      does a read or update operation on the client's client configuration
      endpoint. As the registration access tokens are relatively long-term
      credentials, and since the registration access token is a Bearer token
      and acts as the sole authentication for use at the client configuration
      endpoint, it MUST be protected by the developer or client as described
      in <xref target="RFC6750">OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage</xref>.</t>

      <t>Since requests to the client configuration endpoint result in the
      transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and
      response), the authorization server MUST require the use of a
      transport-layer security mechanism when sending requests to the
      endpoint. The server MUST support TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246">RFC
      5246</xref> and MAY support additional transport-layer mechanisms
      meeting its security requirements. When using TLS, the client MUST
      perform a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per <xref
      target="RFC6125">RFC 6125</xref>. Implementation security considerations
      can be found in <xref target="TLS.BCP">Recommendations for Secure Use of
      TLS and DTLS</xref>.</t>

      <t>Since possession of the registration access token authorizes the
      holder to potentially read, modify, or delete a client&rsquo;s
      registration (including its credentials such as a client_secret), the
      registration access token MUST contain sufficient entropy to prevent a
      random guessing attack of this token, such as described in <xref
      target="RFC6750"/> Section 5.2 and <xref target="RFC6819"/> Section
      5.1.4.2.2.</t>

      <t>If a client is deprovisioned from a server, any outstanding
      registration access token for that client MUST be invalidated at the
      same time. Otherwise, this can lead to an inconsistent state wherein a
      client could make requests to the client configuration endpoint where
      the authentication would succeed but the action would fail because the
      client is no longer valid. The authorization server MUST treat all such
      requests as if the registration access token was invalid by returning an
      HTTP 401 Unauthorized error, as described.</t>

    <section anchor="Credentials"
             title="Registration Tokens and Client Credentials">
      <t>Throughout the course of the dynamic registration protocol, there are
      three different classes of credentials in play, each with different
      properties and targets.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The initial access token is optionally used by the client or
          developer at the registration endpoint. This is an OAuth 2.0 token
          that is used to authorize the initial client registration request.
          The content, structure, generation, and validation of this token are
          out of scope for this specification. The authorization server can
          use this token to verify that the presenter is allowed to
          dynamically register new clients. This token may be shared among
          multiple instances of a client to allow them to each register
          separately, thereby letting the authorization server use this token
          to tie multiple instances of registered clients (each with their own
          distinct client identifier) back to the party to whom the initial
          access token was issued, usually an application developer. This
          token is usually intended to be used only at the client registration
          endpoint.</t>

          <t>The registration access token is used by the client or developer
          at the client configuration endpoint and represents the holder's
          authorization to manage the registration of a client. This is an
          OAuth 2.0 bearer token that is issued from the client registration
          endpoint in response to a client registration request and is
          returned in a client information response. The registration access
          token is uniquely bound to the client identifier and is required to
          be presented with all calls to the client configuration endpoint.
          The registration access token should be protected as described in
          <xref target="RFC6750"/> and should not be shared between instances
          of a client. If a registration access token is shared between client
          instances, one instance could change or delete registration values
          for all other instances of the client. The registration access token
          can be rotated through the use of the client read or update method
          on the client configuration endpoint. The registration access token
          is intended to be used only at the client configuration
          endpoint.</t>

          <t>The client credentials (such as <spanx style="verb">client_secret</spanx>)
          are optional depending on the type of client and are used to
          retrieve OAuth tokens. Client credentials are most often bound to
          particular instances of a client and should not be shared between
          instances. Note that since not all types of clients have client
          credentials, they cannot be used to manage client registrations at
          the client configuration endpoint. The client credentials can be
          rotated through the use of the client read or update method on the
          client configuration endpoint. The client credentials are intended
          to be used only at the token endpoint.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section anchor="CredentialRotation" title="Credential Rotation">
        <t>The authorization server may be configured to issue new
        registration access tokens and/or client credentials (such as a <spanx
        style="verb">client_secret</spanx>) throughout the lifetime of the
        client. This may help minimize the impact of exposed credentials. The
        authorization server conveys new registration access tokens and client
        credentials (if applicable) to the client in the client information
        response of either a read or update request to the client
        configuration endpoint. The client's current registration access token
        and client credentials (if applicable) MUST be included in the client
        information response.</t>

        <t>The registration access token SHOULD be rotated only in response to
        a read or update request to the client configuration endpoint, at
        which point the new registration access token is returned to the
        client and the old registration access token MUST be discarded by the
        client and SHOULD be discarded by the server, if possible. If instead
        the registration access token were to expire or be invalidated outside
        of such requests, the client or developer might be locked out of
        managing the client's configuration.</t>

        <t>Note that the authorization server decides the frequency of the
        credential rotation and not the client. Methods by which the client
        can request credential rotation are outside the scope of this
        document.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ClientConfigEndpointURL"
             title="Forming the Client Configuration Endpoint URL">
      <t>The authorization server MUST provide the client with the fully
      qualified URL in the <spanx style="verb">registration_client_uri</spanx>
      element of the Client Information Response, as specified in <xref
      target="ClientInfoResponse"/>. The authorization server MUST NOT expect
      the client to construct or discover this URL on its own. The client MUST
      use the URL as given by the server and MUST NOT construct this URL from
      component pieces.</t>

      <t>Depending on deployment characteristics, the client configuration
      endpoint URL may take any number of forms. It is RECOMMENDED that this
      endpoint URL be formed through the use of a server-constructed URL
      string which combines the client registration endpoint's URL and the
      issued <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx> for this client, with the
      latter as either a path parameter or a query parameter. For example, a
      client with the client identifier <spanx style="verb">s6BhdRkqt3</spanx>
      could be given a client configuration endpoint URL of <spanx
      style="verb">https://server.example.com/register/s6BhdRkqt3</spanx>
      (path parameter) or of <spanx style="verb">https://server.example.com/register?client_id=s6BhdRkqt3</spanx>
      (query parameter). In both of these cases, the client simply uses the
      URL as given by the authorization server.</t>

      <t>These common patterns can help the server to more easily determine
      the client to which the request pertains, which MUST be matched against
      the client to which the registration access token was issued. If
      desired, the server MAY simply return the client registration endpoint
      URL as the client configuration endpoint URL and change behavior based
      on the authentication context provided by the registration access
      token.</t>
